      "description": "Hello.\n\nI am Bernal Varela, Galician software developer from A Coruña, I have been working in what I like, creating software, since 2007 and loving computers since I have memory.\n\nI'm a father of three, sports lover and cyclist when the weather allows it. I can't imagine my life without music, I play some instruments that give me peace of mind when I'm stressed. I like movies, video games, and board games.\nThis is what I like, but all the things that I like to do usually don't fit very well with my children's schedule.\n\nHow i'm i? I think I'm an optimistic and calm person with high level stress control, I like people, I like what I do and I like to do it well, I'm usually very demanding of myself and sometimes it stresses me. I am a curious person and I am used to evolving and trying to stay up to date with all the changes and updates of the technologies we are using.",
